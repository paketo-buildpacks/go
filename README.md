# Go Paketo Buildpack

## `gcr.io/paketo-buildpacks/go`

The Go Paketo Buildpack provides a set of collaborating buildpacks that
enable the building of a Go-based application. These buildpacks include:
- [Go Distribution CNB](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/go-dist)
- [Go Mod Vendor CNB](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/go-mod-vendor)
- [Go Build CNB](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/go-build)

The buildpack supports building applications that use either the built-in [Go
modules](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Module_maintenance) feature for managing
their dependencies. Usage examples can be found in the
[`samples` repository under the `go` directory](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/samples/tree/main/go).
